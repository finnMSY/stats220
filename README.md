# Stats220
Welcome to this Stats220 repository where I will be sharing my various projects created during my time as part of stats220 course in the university using the programming language `R`.
>*These projects can be viewed on this [website](https://finnmsy.github.io/stats220/)*

## Current projects
1.	My current project is creating a meme using `R` code and using it within a report where I will dicuss my process. I will also create an animated GIF which will also be used for project but won't be on this repository.
2.	*More projects coming soon*
